# Data-Structures
A stack is created using classic class with push , pop , peek , is_empty operations

I created a custom class with the core stack operations:

ðŸ”¹push( ) â€“ adds items to the stack

ðŸ”¹pop( )- Removes the last added item

ðŸ”¹peek( ) â€“ View the top item without removing

ðŸ”¹is_empty( ) â€“ Check if the stack is empty

The push() method is enhanced to accept multiple items at once using *args.
